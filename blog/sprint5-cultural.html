                I have read through the past reflections on each sprint learnings and have found three new things about myself. I would first read the core learning part of the sprint and get the overall idea of what core skills I will have to try and acquire in each sprint. 
                <br><br>
                The activity in core skills requires you to acquire a certain mindset that prepares you to program or think like a developer. For example, it asks you to think and write about the difference between EQ and IQ and how important each of them are.

                <br><br>
        <div class="para-2">
            <p>
                It was a new experience for me as until this day I have not really thought much about the topics in core skills section. It was like trying to think about the things that you have never been interested in.
                <br><br>
                To be honest, first time I started this foundation course, when I saw the core skills where you had to download this app called headspace, do some mediatiting, write a reflection on it, I thought, "maybe they don't really teach coding, and just teach you to think clearly?".
            </p>

                <br><br>
        <div class="para-3">
            <p>
                But after doing reflections in core skills, trying meditating, doing research on how my brain works, and what helps me learn more efficiently I have come to realise that it is more helpful than I thought it would be. I now think that it sets up your mindset and study coding or anything in your life. These skills have helped me get less frustrated, as I started telling myself that I can pick this up whenever I get stuck on a challenge and reflect on what I thought during the last sprint and activity.
                <br><br>
                Core skills have helped me in many aspects, is changing the way I do things and improving it could improve me to become a skilled developer.
