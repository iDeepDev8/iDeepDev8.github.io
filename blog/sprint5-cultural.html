                I have read through the past reflections on each sprint learnings and have found three new things about myself. I would first read the core learning part of the sprint and get the overall idea of what core skills I will have to try and acquire in each sprint. 
                <br><br>
                The activity in core skills requires you to acquire a certain mindset that prepares you to program or think like a developer. For example, it asks you to think and write about the difference between EQ and IQ and how important each of them are.
                <br><br>
            </p>
            </div>
                <br><br>
        <div class="para-2">
            <p>
                It was a new experience for me as until this day I have not really thought much about the topics in core skills section. It was like trying to think about the things that you have once thought about but have not planned them out or use in my daily life as much.
                <br><br>
                Also, writing a blog about my identity and my value has been a chance for me to think more about who I am, how I think, act and how my motto and my value interacts with certain situations. 
                <br><br>
                Drawing a map of my learning plan has helped me think more about why I am taking this course, where this learning new skills could take me to. It has led me to set a clearer goal for my future career and I am still drawing plans on what web development skills I really want to specialize in.

            <p>
                But after writing blogs on EQ and IQ, Neuroplasticity and grown mindset doing research on how my brain works, and what helps me learn more efficiently I have come to realise that these are mind skills that I really have to work on in order to work and think more efficiently. I now think that it sets up your mindset and study coding or anything in your life. These skills have helped me get less frustrated, as I started telling myself that I can pick this up whenever I get stuck on a challenge and reflect on how I faced the difficulties during the last sprint and challenges.
                <br><br>
                Core skills have helped me in many aspects, is changing the way I do things and improving it could improve me to become a skilled developer and a better person and I see why EDA emphasizes the importance of core learning.
