                During Sprint 4 I was stuck on one of the Kata challenges, the one where you had to manipulate javascript objects, which in grammar sense is giving each words names like nouns, verbs, adjectives. I was stuck on the same problem for a long time. 
            <br>
                I googled the same issue and couldn't find any close answers. So I had some of the peers in my cohort to help me on this issue, and the problem turned out to be not the object in this case names of each word in grammar, but the commas and organizing the words itself. It helped me solve the problem I was stuck on as well as remind me of how important it is to put commas and brackets in the right place, even when you are writing a sentence and also when you are writing a code.

                Throughout the sprints I have used pseudocode which enabled me to navigate through different codes as it worked well as a sticky note, read what the error messages said, console logged in order to check if the code worked, googled what new methods could be used in some situations, asked peers and coaches to help and writing the reflections has also made me look back on what I have studied, what I have learned from it, what I can improve. In most cases, while I was writing reflections I realised that I still have missed out some details from the sprints and makes me go back to the part I missed and study it again. 
            <br>
                From trying variety of problem solving methods I am confident in using the sources in order to solve the problem.
