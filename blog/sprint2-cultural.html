                    Before I enrolled in this course, I studied logistics and have had plans to work in the industry, but it did not work out as I was not really dedicated to the field as I had slowly lost interest. I have been introduced to web development by one of my friend not long ago. I did not know what it was at that time as I didn't even know much about how computers and websites work except the time when I got interested in hacking and tried out some of the codes myself, which was hard as I did not have knowledge of coding.

                <p>
                    I have studied basics of html css and javascript before enrolling just to prepare myself for the upcoming wave of coding. During the self-study I have realised that coding is not as hard and complicated as I thought before as long as you understand how they work, when you use them and what types are available. It is starting to interest me a lot as the coding itself is very clean and organized but still is strong enough to change things. When I come across a problem, the questions I ask could be weird in a way as I assume I have a different way of seeing things.

                    My weakness could be that when a lot of work has to be done it gives me a feeling that my brain has stopped or lagged for few minutes and if one of the work gets done my brain is turned on and starts working again.

                <p>
                    While I am in foundations and the bootcamp I might not be a loud mouthed person but I am prepared to try hard and consistently dedicate myself to the course as I know that no matter how much I learn there still will be more to learn as one of my favourite web developing youtuber has said "It is almost impossible to know everything when it comes to learning how to code". I hope to be more skilled in coding, think more like a developer, improve my strength which is coming up with solutions when I encounter a problem, learn how to co-op with other developers in my cohort as well as the company I will be working in after I graduate.

                    My expectation from the facilitation team could be just to encourage me to be a better web developer, be able to answer most of my questions if not all and most important of all making Dev Academy the same as how you would make a Web.

                    I am happy to be part of this course. I hope that the thinking that this would be the best choice I have ever made in choosing what I would do with my life and what I would learn would last long enough for me to be encouraged everyday.
