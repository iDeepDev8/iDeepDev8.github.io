                    I still have not decided my long term goal and career pathway as a web developer, but I am interested in managing big data, and game developing. I know that those two fields would require me to learn other backend languages and software developing technologies. So my first goal is to first learn and get used to developing the web using html,css and javascript. Once I get a junior or intermediate web developing position and get skillful enough using them, I am planning to learn new languages such as python to take my web developing career to the next level. I will be narrowing down the range of goals throughout bootcamp. As I learn more about web development it would allow me to see my potentials and what it could possibly lead me to.

                <p>
                    I think my biggest strengths that would benefit me during bootcamp are self-control, trying hard and dedication to my work. Those strengths have grown more during the foundations sprints while I was completing my challenges and learning more about html,css and javascript. I found myself being so focused on the obstacle, trying to fix it and self-controlling myself whenever I wanted to give up solving the problem. My weakness in bootcamp would be doing more difficult things with javascript as I am still struggling with using it.

                <p>
                    The biggest non-technical challenge at bootcamp will be communicating with others. Even though, I can speak English, I sometimes feel like I am having difficulty giving a 100% explanation of my thoughts and ideas in English. I am hoping that working with others at bootcamp could help me improve that skill. Also I am planning to practice controlling my anxiety and stress while working on different projects in bootcamp as I seem to worry about little things too much. I would like to see myself being more self-aware, active communicator and a team-working developer that could perhaps be able to lead the team.
                </p>
                <br><br>
                <p>
                    My expectations from the bootcamp team has not changed since sprint-2. I still expect bootcamp team to make and become a great web developing environment where I can learn both techincal web developing skills and human skills that will lead me to being a skilled developer everyone wants.
                </p>
                <br><br>
                <p>
                    During bootcamp I will be asking for help whenever I encounter a problem after trying to find the answer myself. I am planning to actively communicate with the team and facilitators through slack and video calls as web developing is all about problem solving as well as team-working and helping each other.

                    Before I enrolled in this course, I studied logistics and have had plans to work in the industry, but it did not work out as I was not really dedicated to the field as I had slowly lost interest. I have been introduced to web development by one of my friend not long ago. I did not know what it was at that time as I didn't even know much about how computers and websites work except the time when I got interested in hacking and tried out some of the codes myself, which was hard as I did not have knowledge of coding.

                <p>
                    I have studied basics of html css and javascript before enrolling just to prepare myself for the upcoming wave of coding. During the self-study I have realised that coding is not as hard and complicated as I thought before as long as you understand how they work, when you use them and what types are available. It is starting to interest me a lot as the coding itself is very clean and organized but still is strong enough to change things. When I come across a problem, the questions I ask could be weird in a way as I assume I have a different way of seeing things.

                    My weakness could be that when a lot of work has to be done it gives me a feeling that my brain has stopped or freezed for few minutes and if one of the work gets done my brain is turned on and starts working again.

                    While I am in foundations and the bootcamp I might not be a talkative person but I am prepared to try hard and consistently dedicate myself to the course as I know that no matter how much I learn there still will be more to learn as one of my favourite web developing youtuber has said "It is almost impossible to know everything when it comes to learning how to code". I hope to be more skilled in coding, think more like a developer, improve my strength which is coming up with solutions when I encounter a problem, learn how to co-op with other developers in my cohort as well as the company I will be working in after I graduate.

                    My expectation from the facilitation team could be just to encourage me to be a better web developer, be able to answer most of my questions if not all and most important of all making Dev Academy the same as how you would make a Web.

                    I am happy to be part of this course. I hope that the thinking that this would be the best choice I have ever made in choosing what I would do with my life and what I would learn would last long enough for me to be encouraged everyday.
