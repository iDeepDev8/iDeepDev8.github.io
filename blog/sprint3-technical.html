                <h1>What is a DOM? and what makes the Web</h1>
                <br>
                <p>
                    If you go to any web pages, when they load the browser creates a DOM of the page which is also known as Document Object Model.
                    It is a World Wide Web Consortium standard which means that it is a World Wide standard form of defining the Elements in the Web.
                    DOM could be pictured as a graph :
                </p>
                <br><br>
                <div class="Dom-img">
                    <img src="../blog/img/DOM.png" alt="DOMgraphimg" height="700px" width="1000px">
                </div>
        </div>
            <br><br>
        <div class="para-2">
                <h2>The W3C DOM standard is separated into 3 different parts:</h2>
                <br><br>
                <p>
                    <b>DOM</b> - standard model for all document types
                    <b>XML DOM</b> - standard model for XML documents
                    <b>HTML DOM</b> - standard model for HTML documents
                </p>
                <br><br>
                <p>
                    we will be going more into that in another blog
                    The cool thing about DOM is that you can manipulate everything using the language Javascript. You can add, remove the DOM element, add events to it, add functions to it and much more.
                    So in other words DOM is like a glue that sticks all the elements together and Javascript is a chemical that allows you to make changes to DOM. 
                    On the browser if you go into Developers' tools:
                </p>
                <br><br>
                <div class="Devtool-img">
                    <img src="../blog/img/Dev-tool.png" alt="Devtoolimg" height="700px" width="1000px">
                </div>
        </div>
            <br><br>
        <div class="para-3">
            <p>    
                you can see what each element is called, how it is built and what each of the elements does by hovering over each elements on the web page.
                You can try it out for yourself and make changes using Dev Tools. 

                Now we know what DOM is let's learn more about the elements. There are two languages that makes makes up the web other than javascript, which are HTMl and CSS, one of the most basic languages in Web Development.
                <br><br>
                HTML is a language that builds the skeleton of the webpage, like a skeletal structure of the web, while css adds more flesh to the skeleton which makes it more colorful, clean and clear to see.
                Now you might be wondering, what does Javascript do exactly, how does it manipulate the the basic structure? You see, Javascript has something called Control flow, Loops, Arrays, Objects and Functions. 
                Let me explain to you what each of them is.  
            </p>
        </div>
            <br><br>
            <div class="para-4">
            <p> 
                Control Flow is a crucial aspect of programming languages that allow your code to take certain actions based on a variety of scenarios. It is the most fundamental concept in programming, in this case Javascript that allows you to dictate how your code runs 
                under different conditions or until it is met. The examples would be If,Else,Else if,Operators,Nesting,And,Or,Switch,For,For in,While,DO While,Breaks.
                They are important when coding in Javascript because they tells the code when to take what actions on which situation. This makes the code more clean and easy to put in action in the right order. 
                <br><br><hr><br>
                <b>Array</b> is a special variable which can hold more than one value at a time, you could also describe is as a box with different things in it.
                <br><hr><br>
                <b>Loop</b> is a programming function that iterates or repeat a statement or condtition based on specified boundaries, in this case the scenario of the code.
                <br><hr><br>
                <b>Object</b> are variables to, but it can contain many values like Arrays do, but it can also include multiple arrays. So if the array was a box, then Object would be a bigger container.
                <br><hr><br>
                <b>Function</b> is also one of the fundamental building blocks in javascript. It is a procedure in which a set of statements are put in to perform a certain task in a certain scenario in order to calculate and bring out the conclusion for the code. 
                It is highly useful as it can be used to add functions to the html elements such as changing features when clicked, or when another event occurs on the element and allows us to add mathematical formula to the element.

                <p>
                    Now we have learned what each of the elements are and how they work, we can learn how to write each code in another blog :)
