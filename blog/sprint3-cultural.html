                Intelligence also an EQ refers to a person's ability to understand his/her emotion along with the other person's emotions.
                EQ is different to IQ as IQ tells us how intelligent him/her is and tells us the level of the person's intelligence level, which could be acquired from learning, studying and researching more.
            <br>
                EQ is important because it gives you the understanding of how to interact with another human being, control your emotions, be able to share and discuss
                your knowledge which is part of an IQ. If you have a high level of IQ, but has a lack of an EQ level, then you would not be able to fully express and share your 
                ideas in a right way.
