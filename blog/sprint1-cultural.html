                    I was born in New Zealand, Wellington, and have gone to kindergarten, primary school, and middle school in Korea and Christchurch. I have attended highschool in Korea and have graduated in a different highschool in Australia Sydney. I have been on and off Korea and Auckland since then.

                    Since when I was a kid I have had to move to many different countries, cities, schools and houses. I have had to meet new friends and people who I would not be seeing after 2 years when I graduate each school I went to as I had to move to another country then. This experience has affected and is still affecting my identity.

                    In a positive way I have had a chance to meet a lot of people with different cultural background, and ideas. This has turned me into a person with a mixture of different cultures inside me which allowed me to have more understanding for different cultures, new ideas and gave me the ability to adapt to new environment and habits quickly. This has become my strength in learning new things, embracing the difference in ideas and reduce the conflicts by coming up with a solution that everyone could possibly agree on. In most situations, as we are very distinct from each other we often end up having one side of the argument win while the other is not satisfied and chooses not to support the conclusion in any ways. From my experience I have been in one of these situations where the employees were not satisfied with the schedule set by the employer when I was doing a part time job 2 years ago. In that moment I was able to come up with a solution that fulfilled the needs of both sides by listening to each sides' proposals, asking each sides to understand each other. This was possible as I could embrace both opinions, knew exactly what they wanted and knew how to mix them together into a solution.

                    I use this method personally. When I am doing some work, there is always two different thoughts in my head. One that stops me and puts me down, and the other that encourages me. I usually talk to myself and try to listen to the positive side of me, but in most cases I end up accepting both sides and still get my work done.
