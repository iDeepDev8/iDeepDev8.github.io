                When learning new things, coming across an obstacle in your work or study there are two skills that your brain needs to build in order to solve the problem, transform them into a new learning and turn it into your own skill and experience.
                <br>
                These two skills are Neuroplasticity and Growth Mindset. Let me clear out what they are and how they can be helpful to us.

            <h2>Neuroplasticity</h2>
            <br>
            <p>
                Neuroplasticity is a word to discribe how our brain works and moves just like a plastic does. It is more flexible and adaptable than we think it is. There are many ways to improve the neuroplasticity of our brain and one of the ways works in a process of: 
            <br>
                Setting goals you want to achieve
                Recognizing what triggers(motivates) you to do start working for your goal
                Making conscious decisions during the process
                Seeking for reward to encourage yourself
                The new pathway of learning a new skill or subject is strengthened
                Eventually it becomes your new habbit and your own knowledge. 
            <br>
                You can try this method when you are stuck on a problem you have never encountered or have never thought of possibly completing it yourself. It works like a cheatcode that tricks your brain and trains it to think as if you can do it. 
            </p>

            <h2>Growth Mindset</h2>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Growth Mindset is what motivates us to give our brain more neuroplasticity when faced with a problem or a first-time experience in order to help us adapt to it and form our brain into an elastic that could change in a new shape in order to absorb the information. 
                <br>    
                    To me, growth mindset seems like a positive thinking that puts your brain in a trance that encourages you to learn and adapt to new habbits, problem solving. This is very helpful when you come across a certain assignment that you are not familiar with, but have to get used to in order to go to the next step. If you call your brain a mold then growth mindset would be flexible mold.
